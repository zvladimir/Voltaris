# Voltaris

## Concept

**Voltaris** is a tool for designing and analyzing power supply systems. It is intended for engineers, designers, and developers working on complex systems such as cars, satellites, servers, and advanced PCBs.  

With Voltaris, users can:

- Create schematics of power sources and loads.
- Analyze current loads and efficiency.
- Identify potential weak points in the system.
- Perform both static and dynamic energy consumption analysis.

Voltaris is envisioned as a flexible tool that combines visualization, calculation, and simulation in one interface.

## Mission

The goal of Voltaris is to enable engineers to **quickly and clearly design power systems**, avoiding overloads, losses, and critical errors. Voltaris helps turn complex systems into predictable, safe, and optimized solutions.

---

## Unique Value

- **Engineer-focused:** designed for real-world complex system projects.
- **Combination of visual design and analytical calculations.**
- **Scalable:** from simple PCBs to complex servers or satellites.
- **Potential for integration** with other engineering tools and simulators.

## Status

Currently, this repository contains **idea documentation and conceptual sketches**. No implementation code exists yet â€” the purpose of this repository is to establish idea ownership.

---

## Possible Development

- **Graphical power schematic editor:** components, connections, sources, and loads.
- **Calculation of currents, voltages, and efficiency.**
- **Weak point analysis** in power distribution.
- **Two modes:** static (fixed calculations) and dynamic (load response analysis).
